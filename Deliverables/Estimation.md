| NC = Estimated number of classes to be developed                                                        |    14    |
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC                                                            |   187    |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC \* A)                                                       |   2620   |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                    |   262    |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                     |  7860â‚¬   |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 2 weeks  |
