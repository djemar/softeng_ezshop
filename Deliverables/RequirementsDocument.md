# Essential description

Small shops require a simple application to support the owner or manager. A small shop (ex a food shop) occupies 50-200 square meters, sells 500-2000 different item types, has one or a few cash registers
EZShop is a software application to:

- manage sales

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram

\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

```plantuml
scale 300 width
top to bottom direction
actor Owner as o
actor Employee as e
actor CashRegister as cr
actor Item as i
actor Accountant as acc
actor Cashier as cas
actor FidelityCard as f
actor PoS as pos

o -up-|> acc
cas -up-|> e
acc -up-|> cas
i -> (EZShop)
e -> (EZShop)
f -> (EZShop)
cr -> (EZShop)
pos -> (EZShop)
```

## Interfaces

\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

\<Maybe employee is enough, owner can be removed?>

| Actor         | Logical Interface |                                       Physical Interface |
| ------------- | :---------------: | -------------------------------------------------------: |
| Item          |      Barcode      |                                          Barcode scanner |
| Employee      |      Web GUI      | Screen, keyboard, mouse on PC, touchscreen on smartphone |
| Owner         |      Web GUI      | Screen, keyboard, mouse on PC, touchscreen on smartphone |
| FidelityCard  |      Barcode      |                                          Barcode scanner |
| Cash Register |      Web GUI      |                                       Local network link |
| Pos           |     Visa API      |                                            Internet link |

# Stories and personas

\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>

The following personas and stories are meant to cover different profiles of the Owner actors.

David is 34, he played tennis for many years and now he is the owner of a sports shop in a little city. He loves speaking with his customers and giving precious advice about the best rackets that he has in his inventory. He would like to be grateful to his customers for their trust with some special discounts every 100 euros spent. Additionally, he would like to know exactly how many rackets are available in his warehouse in order to immediately advertise to his customers that a certain item is quickly being sold.

Elisabeth is 25, she is a young entrepreneur and she studied the market strategies at Bocconi. She opened her first clothes shop in the middle of Milan 2 years ago and she advertises her season collection on Instagram. She has found some difficulties because Milan is the capital of fashion where there is a great number of rich Chinese and Russian tourists that require a high level of service: on many occasion clothes sizes had finished quickly, she forgot to order them and her customers were unsatisfied. She would like to have an alarm that notifies the low quantity of her clothes sizes.

Tom is 40, he is the accountant of an Irish pub called "Dubliners". This pub is very famous for the quality of its whisky that is the best in the city and it also offers a variety of cheap craft beers. Unfortunately, four years ago Tom had some serious economical issues because the prices of his products were too low and he didn't have enough money to pay employees salary. He would like to manage well his receipts and the prices of the products to satisfy both customers and employees.

Katia is 50, she is the owner of a fish market. 2 years ago she employed her son John as a cashier because he was jobless. He doesn't have a good relationship with technology and he prefers using the calculator to obtain the total payments. Additionally, Katia discovered that he didn't make receipts and one day she had to pay an expensive fine. John would like to use an easy application that shows the cost of each product, calculates autonomously the total cost and shows it on the screen. Additionally, he would like an error message when the payment was not successful and so the receipt was not issued.
