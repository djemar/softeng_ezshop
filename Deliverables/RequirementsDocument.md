# Essential description

Small shops require a simple application to support the owner or manager. A small shop (ex a food shop) occupies 50-200 square meters, sells 500-2000 different item types, has one or a few cash registers
EZShop is a software application to:

- manage sales
- manage inventory
- manage customers
- support accounting

# Stakeholders

| Customer         |                      Uses the application to manage his profile and to check his fidelity points and related offers                      |
| Administrator    |                                                  Manages the application and its rights                                                  |
| Developer        |                  Develops and tests software to meet clients needs and monitors quality and performance of application                   |

| Employee         | Uses the application to find information about his work shifts and, depending on his access rights, managing items and customer profiles |

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram

\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

```plantuml
top to bottom direction
actor Owner as o
actor Employee as e
actor CashRegister as ca
actor Inventory as in
actor Accountant as acc

o -up-|> acc
acc -up-|> e
in -> (EZShop)
e -> (EZShop)
ca -> (EZShop)
```

## Interfaces

\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

\<Maybe employee is enough, owner can be removed?>

| Actor         | Logical Interface |                                       Physical Interface |
| ------------- | :---------------: | -------------------------------------------------------: |
| Inventory     |      Barcode      |                                          Barcode scanner |
| Employee      |      Web GUI      | Screen, keyboard, mouse on PC, touchscreen on smartphone |
| Owner         |      Web GUI      | Screen, keyboard, mouse on PC, touchscreen on smartphone |
| Cash Register |        API        |                                       local network link |

# Stories and personas

\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>

The following personas and stories are meant to cover different profiles of the Owner actors. 

Davis is the owner of a sport shop, he opened it 2 years before. He started with only 2 employees, so it was easy to organize workshifts, now he has 6 employees and it becomes more complicated.

Elisabeth has a grocery store. Unfotunately more than one time customers found expired items on the shelves; she would like to recognize the food in expiration and apply a discount to it.

Sophie manages a clothes shop, she noticed that her employees lost much time in searching for the right sizes of the clothes in the warehouse if not present in the shop.


# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

\<In the form DO SOMETHING, or VERB NOUN, describe high level capabilities of the system>

\<they match to high level use cases>
